<p class="introduction">As long as I can remember, I have always gravitated around research in data analytics models and analytical techniques. Since my childhood when I
had my first contact with computers and videogames, I developed a passion for them and how they work has propelled me towards a career in Software Engineering. Thus, logical reasoning, ability with numbers, analysis of graphs and data have always been part of my life, and drives me to explore new concepts and technologies, along with natural an instinct for research and curiosity in discovering new things.</p>
